# AI-CSCI561
Programs developed for CSCI561 Foundations of Artificial Intelligence course
 
# Program 1 - Search 
 # Mars Exploration mission path finder
	Given the topographical map of the mission site with Z value assigned to each cell identifying the elevation of the planet, the Program moves the rover optimally from its landing site to all of its target locations for experiments.

	Approaches: Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, A\* Search
	Language: Python

# Program 2 - Game Playing using Minimax
 # Halma Game playing agent
	Designed a Game Playing agent for Halma, a version of Chinese checkers, using Minimax algorithm. The game consists of Black and White pawns located at the opposite ends of a square board. Pawns can move one step or two steps or even jump over the adjacent pawns for any number of times. Modified Minimax to suit the time-restricted environment and used Alpha-beta pruning to reduce the branching factor significantly.
	
	Language: Python
	Configuration: Dynamic depth control (Max: 2 Ply or 3 Depth)
	Evalution Function: Mix of Euclidean distances
	Result: Agent came in the top 7th of 750 students in the AI Tournament sponsored by Google

# HW3 - First Order Logic
 # Logic Resolution Engine
	Implemented a First Order Logic Resolution engine for sentences after converting to CNF form. Used Backward chaining with unification of sentences, including variable to variable unification.

	Algorithm implemeted: Unification, Resolution
	Language: Python
